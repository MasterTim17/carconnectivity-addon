- Add Expert Mode

  Expert Mode enables the use of all native Carconnectivity functions, including those not available through the graphical interface—as long as the corresponding functions are supported by the add-on binaries.

  ⚠️ Warning:
  This mode disables all content validation and safety checks. As a result, even a small mistake (such as an invalid JSON syntax) can prevent the add-on from launching correctly.

  Expert Mode is intended for advanced users only.
  To use it safely, you must:

  Be familiar with JSON syntax and structure.

  Refer to the official Carconnectivity documentation for the list of supported functions and expected parameters.
